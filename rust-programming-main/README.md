# Rust Learning Exercises

This repository contains code and exercises that follow the [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) chapter by chapter. It also includes personal experiments and implementations of various Rust concepts.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into modules that demonstrate different Rust features and concepts, such as:

- Enums and Traits
- File I/O
- Error Handling
- Regular Expressions
- Structs and Implementations

### Example: Log Analyzer

One of the exercises in this repository is a simple log analyzer that:

- Parses log files.
- Filters logs by log levels (`INFO`, `WARN`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, `ALL`).
- Outputs logs in a structured format.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeremycod/rust-learning-exercises.git
   cd rust-learning-exercises


# Learning Goals
This repository is a personal learning project aimed at:
- Understanding Rust's ownership model.
- Practicing error handling with Result and Option.
- Exploring Rust's standard library and crates like regex.
- Building small, functional programs.
